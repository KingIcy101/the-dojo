## TransitionSeries

`<TransitionSeries>` arranges scenes with two ways to enhance the cut:
- **Transitions** (`<TransitionSeries.Transition>`) — crossfade, slide, wipe, etc. between scenes. Shortens timeline (scenes overlap during transition).
- **Overlays** (`<TransitionSeries.Overlay>`) — effect on top of cut, does NOT shorten timeline.

## Prerequisites

```bash
npx remotion add @remotion/transitions
```

## Transition example

```tsx
import { TransitionSeries, linearTiming } from "@remotion/transitions";
import { fade } from "@remotion/transitions/fade";

<TransitionSeries>
  <TransitionSeries.Sequence durationInFrames={60}>
    <SceneA />
  </TransitionSeries.Sequence>
  <TransitionSeries.Transition
    presentation={fade()}
    timing={linearTiming({ durationInFrames: 15 })}
  />
  <TransitionSeries.Sequence durationInFrames={60}>
    <SceneB />
  </TransitionSeries.Sequence>
</TransitionSeries>
```

## Available transition types

```tsx
import { fade } from "@remotion/transitions/fade";
import { slide } from "@remotion/transitions/slide";
import { wipe } from "@remotion/transitions/wipe";
import { flip } from "@remotion/transitions/flip";
import { clockWipe } from "@remotion/transitions/clock-wipe";
```

Slide directions: `"from-left"`, `"from-right"`, `"from-top"`, `"from-bottom"`

## Timing options

```tsx
import { linearTiming, springTiming } from "@remotion/transitions";

linearTiming({ durationInFrames: 20 });
springTiming({ config: { damping: 200 }, durationInFrames: 25 });
```

## Duration calculation

With two 60-frame scenes and a 15-frame transition: `60 + 60 - 15 = 105` frames total.
